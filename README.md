**Meal Splitter App**

This app simplifies the process of splitting a meal bill among multiple people. With a user-friendly interface, it ensures everyone reimburses you the right amount, including tax and tip.



How it works:

Scan or Upload Receipt: Scan your receipt with your phone's camera, or upload a photo from your library.

AI-Powered Data Parsing: The app uses AI to extract and organize the meal details, calculating each person's share of the total cost, including tax and tip.

Assign Meals: If some people ordered more than one item, you can highlight the meals assigned to each person.

Venmo Requests: Once everything is sorted, the app automatically sends Venmo requests to each person for the exact amount they owe you.
